# CommuterRailroadService
The train that leaves from King cross to Hogwarts services a number of  in wizard land. Because of monetary concerns from the Mage Council, all of the tracks are 'one-way.' That is, a route from Beaxbatons to Hogwarts does not imply the existence of a route from Hogwarts to Beaxbatons. In fact, even if both of these routes do happen to exist, they are distinct and are not necessarily the same distance! An easy way to think of this, is that in wizard land, trains can only travel down a rail link in one direction! The purpose of this problem is to help the Mage Council provide the rail customers with information about getting to their destinations. In particular, you will compute the distance along a certain route, the number of different routes between two towns, and the shortest route between two towns.
